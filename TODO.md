# Music Looper - Development TODO

## Project Overview
A React Native music player app for iOS that accesses the device's music library and allows users to play and reorder songs for language learning purposes.

## Development Status: Core Implementation Complete âœ…

---

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Foundation âœ…
- [x] **Initialize React Native Project**
  - âœ… Created React Native project with TypeScript
  - âœ… Configured Metro bundler and build tools
  - âœ… Set up folder structure (`src/`, `components/`, `screens/`, `services/`, `types/`)
  - âœ… Removed Android platform (iOS-only focus)

- [x] **iOS Configuration**
  - âœ… Configured `Info.plist` for music library permissions
  - âœ… Added `NSAppleMusicUsageDescription` permission
  - âœ… Set up iOS build configuration

## Phase 2: Core Dependencies âœ…
- [x] **Install Essential Libraries**
  - âœ… `react-native-track-player` - Audio playback
  - âœ… `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` - Local storage
  - âœ… `react-native-permissions` - Permission handling
  - âœ… Navigation library (`@react-navigation/native`)

## Phase 3: Music Library Access âœ…
- [x] **Implement Music Library Service**
  - âœ… Created service to fetch device music library
  - âœ… Handled permission requests for iOS
  - âœ… Parse music metadata (title, artist, album, duration)
  - âœ… Implemented search and filtering functionality

## Phase 4: Audio Player Core âœ…
- [x] **Audio Playback Engine**
  - âœ… Initialized track player service
  - âœ… Implemented play/pause/stop/skip functions
  - âœ… Handle background playback capabilities
  - âœ… Added progress tracking and seeking

## Phase 5: Playlist Management âœ…
- [x] **Sorting & Queue System**
  - âœ… Created playlist data structure with persistence
  - âœ… Implemented track reordering functionality
  - âœ… Added sorting options (title, artist, album, duration)
  - âœ… Save/load custom playlists with AsyncStorage

## Phase 6: User Interface âœ…
- [x] **UI Components**
  - âœ… Music item list component with sorting
  - âœ… Player controls component with full functionality
  - âœ… Progress bar component with seeking
  - âœ… Sortable list component with drag-and-drop support

## Phase 7: Testing & Quality Assurance âœ…
- [x] **Comprehensive Testing**
  - âœ… Unit tests for all services (90 tests passing)
  - âœ… Component tests for UI elements
  - âœ… Type safety validation
  - âœ… Error handling coverage
  - âœ… Permission testing scenarios
  - âœ… Mock implementations for React Native dependencies

- [x] **Code Quality**
  - âœ… ESLint configuration and passing
  - âœ… TypeScript strict mode compliance
  - âœ… Proper component architecture (no nested components)
  - âœ… Jest setup with proper mocking

## Phase 8: State Management (In Progress)
- [ ] **App State Architecture**
  - [ ] Set up global state management (Redux/Zustand)
  - [ ] Manage current track, playlist, and playback state
  - [ ] Handle background state persistence
  - [ ] Integrate services with state management

## Phase 9: Navigation & Screens (Pending)
- [ ] **Screen Components**
  - [ ] Music library browser screen
  - [ ] Now playing screen with controls
  - [ ] Playlist management screen
  - [ ] Settings screen
- [ ] **Navigation Setup**
  - [ ] Configure React Navigation
  - [ ] Define screen stack and navigation flow
  - [ ] Handle deep linking for music playback

## Phase 10: Final Polish (Pending)
- [ ] **Performance & Optimization**
  - [ ] Bundle size optimization
  - [ ] Memory usage optimization
  - [ ] Battery usage optimization for background playback
- [ ] **iOS Device Testing**
  - [ ] Test on physical iOS devices
  - [ ] Verify music library access
  - [ ] Test background playback scenarios

## Implementation Summary

### âœ… Completed Features
- **Core Architecture**: TypeScript-based React Native app with proper folder structure
- **Music Library Access**: Full iOS permission handling and music library integration
- **Audio Playback**: Complete audio player with play/pause/skip/seek functionality
- **Playlist Management**: Create, edit, sort, and persist custom playlists
- **UI Components**: Reusable components for music lists and player controls
- **Testing Suite**: 90 passing tests with comprehensive coverage
- **Code Quality**: Lint-free, type-safe codebase

### ðŸ”„ Current Priority Tasks
1. Implement global state management (Redux/Zustand)
2. Create navigation structure and main screens
3. Integrate all components into complete user flows
4. Performance testing and optimization

### ðŸ“± Technical Stack
- **Framework**: React Native 0.80.1 with TypeScript
- **Audio**: react-native-track-player for music playback
- **Storage**: AsyncStorage for playlist persistence
